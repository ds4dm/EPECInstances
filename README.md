This repository is part of the [EPECSolve](https://github.com/ssriram1992/EPECsolve/) project, and contains the instances on which we perform tests.
- [Code](https://github.com/ssriram1992/EPECsolve/)
- [Instances](https://github.com/ds4dm/EPECInstances) with detailed [mathematical description](https://github.com/ds4dm/EPECInstances/blob/master/Description.pdf)

Goverments act as Stackelberg leaders by trading energy, with the aim of minimizing their emissions, and eventually to maximize tax incomes. Within each country, energy producers act as Stackelberg followers and play a Nash game between themselves, aiming to maximize their profits.  A full description of these instances is available [here](Description.pdf)

 ## A_345
Contains the first set of instances with 3-4-5 contries (50 for each order). 

## H
Contsins the set of harder instances.

## I
Contains the set of instances with 2 countries, 3 followers each, useful to derive strategic insights.

## ChileArgentina
This instance is based on real data from the energy trade between Chile and Argentina. Further information and references will be released.
